# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts **customer churn** using the Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle).  
I applied **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to classify churn and analyzed the key factors.

## ðŸ”¹ Steps Done
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy: 79%, ROC-AUC: 0.83)

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Achieved **79% accuracy**
- Identified key churn drivers: **Tenure, Contract Type, Internet Service**
